# Build Issues Summary

## Current Status
The frontend application works correctly in development mode (`npm run dev`) but fails during production build (`npm run build`).

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Html Import Error
- **Error**: `<Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document`
- **Location**: Occurs during prerendering of `/404`, `/500`, and other error pages
- **Likely Cause**: This appears to be a Next.js internal issue or a conflict with a dependency

### 2. useContext Error
- **Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')`
- **Location**: Occurs during prerendering of all pages
- **Likely Cause**: React context is not available during static generation

## What Works
- ✅ Development mode (`npm run dev`)
- ✅ Backend API endpoints
- ✅ Database migrations
- ✅ User registration functionality (in dev mode)
- ✅ Profile page (in dev mode)

## What Doesn't Work
- ❌ Production build (`npm run build`)
- ❌ Static page generation

## Attempted Solutions
1. Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to force dynamic rendering
2. Removed `next-i18next` dependency
3. Created minimal test pages
4. Modified Next.js configuration

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Skip production build for now** - Focus on development and testing
2. **Use development mode** for local testing and validation
3. **Research Next.js 14 static generation issues** with App Router
4. **Consider alternative i18n solutions** that are compatible with Next.js 14 App Router
5. **Update to latest Next.js version** (currently using 14.0.4, latest is 14.x.x+)

## Workaround for Deployment
Since the build is failing, consider:
1. Using development mode for staging environment
2. Investigating Next.js 15 or staying on Next.js 13 with Pages Router
3. Disabling static optimization completely
4. Using a different deployment strategy that doesn't require production build

## Files Modified
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` - Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- `frontend/app/register/page.tsx` - Removed i18n dependencies
- `frontend/app/profile/[id]/page.tsx` - Removed i18n dependencies  
- `frontend/next.config.js` - Attempted various configuration changes
- `frontend/package.json` - Removed `next-i18next` dependency

## Notes
- The application is fully functional in development mode
- All features work as expected when running `make dev`
- The build issue appears to be environmental/configuration related, not code-related
